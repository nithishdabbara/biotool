BioTool: A Full-Stack Web Application for Bioinformatics Analysis
BioTool is a comprehensive, web-based DNA sequence analyzer built to provide researchers and students with a seamless, powerful, and user-friendly platform for genetic sequence analysis. This full-stack application features a secure Java Spring Boot backend and a dynamic, interactive frontend.

🎯 Problem Statement
In bioinformatics, researchers often face a choice between complex, locally-installed command-line tools or expensive, proprietary software. BioTool was created to bridge this gap, offering a free, accessible, and powerful analysis platform that runs in any modern web browser without any installation required.

✨ Key Features
Secure User Authentication: JWT-based login and registration system to protect user data and analysis history.

Advanced Sequence Analysis: Performs a suite of calculations including:

DNA/RNA Transcription & Protein Translation

GC Content, Reverse Complement, and Melting Temperature (Tm)

Open Reading Frame (ORF) finding to identify potential genes.

Interactive Data Visualization: Dynamic doughnut, bar, and radar charts (powered by Chart.js) for intuitive interpretation of results.

Persistent User History: Logged-in users can save every analysis to their personal account, view a detailed report dashboard, and delete old entries.

Data Management: Functionality to upload sequence files (.fasta, .txt) and export analysis history to CSV.

Modern UI/UX: A sleek, responsive interface with a "glassmorphism" design and dynamic, thematic backgrounds for an engaging user experience.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA, Hibernate

Database: MySQL

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js

Build Tool: Maven
